# 🏆 Task-Switching Experiment

This script defines a **Task-Switching Experiment** designed to study cognitive flexibility and response adaptation. Participants must respond to stimuli consisting of a **letter-number pair**, with task rules determined by the **stimulus location** in a grid.

---

## ✨ How It Works
- Each trial presents a **letter and a number** positioned in either the **top row** or **bottom row** of the grid.
- The location determines which **task type** (Letter Task or Number Task) the participant must perform.
- Participants respond according to **predefined response rules**.

---

## 🎯 Task Types & Response Rules

### **1. Letter Task**
- **Trigger**: The stimulus pair appears in the **top row**.
- **Response Rules**:
  - Press **B** for **consonants** (G, K, M, R).
  - Press **N** for **vowels** (A, E, I, U).

### **2. Number Task**
- **Trigger**: The stimulus pair appears in the **bottom row**.
- **Response Rules**:
  - Press **N** for **odd numbers** (3, 5, 7, 9).
  - Press **B** for **even numbers** (2, 4, 6, 8).
